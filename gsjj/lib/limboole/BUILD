After extracting and compiling at least one of
Lingeling or PicoSAT in '../lingeling'
respectively '../picosat' issue:

   ./configure && make

This also builds 'testlimboole' and 'dimacs2boole'.

You can also compile with debugging support, or force
inclusion of only one of PicoSAT or Lingeling,
e.g., see './configure.sh -h'.
