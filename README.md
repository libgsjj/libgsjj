# Deterministic finite automata learning library
The `libgsjj` is an open-source framework for learning deterministic finite automata. This project was done by Jonathan Joertz and GaÃ«tan Staquet (we named this library after our initials in our humility) for our Master's project at the University of Mons (UMONS).

## Learning deterministic finite automata
This library focuses on passive learning algorithms. In other words, the learning task is the following:
  1. We have a sample \f$S = (S_+, S_-)\f$ over an alphabet \f$\sigma\f$ where \f$S_+\f$ is the finite set of words the DFA must accept and \f$S_-\f$ is the finite set of words the DFA must reject.
  2. We must build the smallest DFA consistent with \f$S\f$. A DFA \f$A\f$ is consistent with \f$S\f$ if \f$S_+ \subseteq L(A) \land S_- \cap L(A) = \emptyset\f$.

To build such a DFA, we use what we call passive learning algorithms. The following algorithms are implemented in `libgsjj`:
  - Biermann and Feldman's algorithm
  - Grinchtein, Leucker and Piterman's unary and binary algorithms
  - Heule and Verwer's algorithm
  - Neider and Jansen's algorithm

## How to use `libgsjj`
### Dependencies to install
To be able to compile and use our library, you will need the install the following dependencies (we also give the Debian and Ubuntu package's name in parenthesis):
  - GMP (libgmp-dev)
  - CVC4 (libcvc4-dev)
  - zlib (zlib1g-dev)
  - Boost (libboost-all-dev)
  - Bison (bison)
  - Flex (flex)
  - PkgConfig (pkg-config or pkgconfig), optional
  - Doxygen and dot (doxygen and graphviz), optional, to build to documentation

The other dependencies are given in this repository.

### How to compile
When you are in the root directory of this library:
```bash
mkdir build && cd build && cmake .. && make
```

This will build the library. If you want to install it, use `make install`. You can change the installation folder with `cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=your/path ..` (or use a graphical interface for CMake).

To enable building the benchmarks, instead of `cmake ..` use `cmake -DBUILD_BENCHMARKS=TRUE ..`.

To enable building the tests, instead of `cmake ..` use `cmake -DBUILD_TESTS=TRUE ..`. You can of course enable the benchmarks and the tests at the same time with `cmake -DBUILD_BENCHMARKS=TRUE -DBUILD_TESTS=TRUE ..`

### How to use in a project
If you use CMake, it's easy. The building stage described before also creates a CMake Config file. Therefore, in your `CMakeLists.txt`, you only have to add the line
```cmake
find_library(gsjj)
```
and `gsjj` will be available a target you can link against. It's possible the user must set the `gsjj_DIR` CMake parameter to be able to build your program if the files are not installed in the standard location.

### Unit tests
Once build, you can launch the unit tests by starting the program `tests` (built in the subfolder `tests` in `build`).

### Benchmarks
Once build, you can launch the benchmarks by starting the program `benchmarks` (built in the subfolder `benchmarks` in `build`).

We give here the modifications done on bcsat. The base files can be found at https://github.com/scrippie/bcsat.

  * On 6 March 2019:
    * Modification of `bcminisat220_solve.cc` to remove log messages.
    * Removing folders `minisat-2.2.0` et `zchaff.2008.10.12`.
  * On 10 March 2019:
    * Modification of `bc.hh`, `bc.cc` and `bcminisat220_solve.cc` to allow the functions to stop when the time limit is reached (the information is propagated through a `std::atomic_bool` object).
